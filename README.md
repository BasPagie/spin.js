# Spin.js
## Synopsis

With this very small library you can spin every element with one click on your page. Click again and it will return to its original position.

## Code Example

The following code is an example of how to use this library:
````
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Spin.js</title>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="spin.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript">
	window.onload = function() {
		$('#hello').spin()
	}
	</script>
</head>
<body>

<img id="hello" src="http://www.microugly.com/images/tutorials/inkscape-small-icon/icon-zoom-pixelated.png" ></img>
<br><br>
</body>
</html>
````
